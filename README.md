# Skin_Disease_Detection_Project
# About the Dataset:
This dataset is a collection of images representing various skin diseases, categorized into 20  classes. It provides an invaluable resource for image classification tasks, particularly in the fields of dermatology and medical diagnostics.

### Skin Diseases:
Acne, Actinic Carcinoma, Atopic Dermatitis, Bullous Disease, Cellulitis, Eczema, Drug Eruptions, Herpes HPV, Light Diseases, Lupus, Melanoma, Poison IVY, Psoriasis, Benign Tumors, Systemic Disease, Ringworm, Urticarial Hives, Vascular Tumors, Vasculitis, Viral Infections.

## Why this project
Skin diseases affect millions globally, ranging from benign conditions like acne to life-threatening conditions like melanoma. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical but access to dermatologists is limited and expensive, especially in underserved regions like Kenya.  

Our project is an Innovative solution that will be implemented to improve healthcare access in rural areas. Telemedicine such as our project are being used to bring healthcare services directly to remote communities. These initiatives leverage technology to connect patients with healthcare professionals who can provide diagnosis, treatment, and advice remotely. 

Healthcare systems in Kenya vary greatly across the counties, with some counties having well-developed systems while others struggle to provide even basic healthcare services.  

### Challenges facing healthcare in Kenya: 

* Lack of funding. 
* Shortage of healthcare professionals. 
* Limited access to medical supplies and equipment.  
* Poverty
  
#### Providing healthcare in rural areas of Kenya presents unique challenges: 
Many rural communities are located far from medical facilities, making it difficult for residents to access healthcare services.

Poor infrastructure, including lack of roads and transportation options, further exacerbates this issue. 

## Objectives:
* Is it possible to upload images to our deployed model to identify the skin disease?
* Improve diagnostic efficiency by automating skin condition  diagnosis and cutting down on delays.
* Expand access by enabling mobile diagnosis tools for rural areas.
* Reduce costs to minimize unnecessary trips to doctors and biopsies.
* Enhance patient outcomes by  supporting early detection of serious conditions like skin cancer.
