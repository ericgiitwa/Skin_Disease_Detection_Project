# Skin_Disease_Detection_Project
# About the Dataset:
This dataset is a collection of images representing various skin diseases, categorized into 20  classes. It provides an invaluable resource for image classification tasks, particularly in the fields of dermatology and medical diagnostics.

### Skin Diseases:
Acne, Actinic Carcinoma, Atopic Dermatitis, Bullous Disease, Cellulitis, Eczema, Drug Eruptions, Herpes HPV, Light Diseases, Lupus, Melanoma, Poison IVY, Psoriasis, Benign Tumors, Systemic Disease, Ringworm, Urticarial Hives, Vascular Tumors, Vasculitis, Viral Infections.

## Why this project
Skin diseases affect millions globally, ranging from benign conditions like acne to life-threatening ones like melanoma. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical but access to dermatologists is limited and expensive, especially in underserved regions like Kenya. Our goal is to be able to upload an image of your skin and our project will be able to classify what type of condition you have.

## Objectives:
* Is it possible to upload images to our deployed model to identify the skin disease?
* Improve diagnostic efficiency by automating skin condition  diagnosis and cutting down on delays.
* Expand access by enabling mobile diagnosis tools for rural areas.
* Reduce costs to minimize unnecessary trips to doctors and biopsies.
* Enhance patient outcomes by  supporting early detection of serious conditions like skin cancer.
